# Architecture

`music2bb` separates terminal interaction, application orchestration, neutral
playlist ingestion, and external-site protocols so the conversion engine can be
reused by another Go frontend.

The CLI depends on the public root package and does not call site clients
directly. The service layer depends on interfaces rather than concrete clients;
production implementations meet those interfaces through `internal/wiring`.
Packages under `internal` are implementation details and cannot be imported by
consumers outside this module.

## Package responsibilities

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `music2bb` | Stable public engine, caller-owned result types, typed errors, observers, and dependency-injection options |
| `cmd/music2bb` | Process startup, signal handling, terminal detection, and build-version reporting |
| `internal/cli` | Shared conversion session, Bubble Tea workspace, plain prompts, review flows, rendering, and exit-code mapping |
| `internal/service` | Use-case orchestration through small client and matcher interfaces |
| `internal/wiring` | Production construction and adapters between service interfaces and concrete clients |
| `internal/playlist` | Provider identification, typed optimizations, candidate decoding, merging, and browser-fallback coordination |
| `internal/model` | I/O-free domain records and song/search normalization |
| `internal/matcher` | Balanced query phases, candidate filtering, scoring, ranking, review reasons, and selection thresholds |
| `internal/kugou` | Browser-free Kugou protocol optimization, response parsing, and song cleanup |
| `internal/applemusic` | Browser-free Apple Music share-page identification and `serialized-server-data` playlist extraction |
| `internal/bilibili` | Authentication, search, WBI signing, cookies, and favorite operations |
| `internal/browser` | Bundled/downloaded Chromium verification, lazy installation, and provider-neutral dynamic-page candidate extraction |
| `internal/config` | State paths, embedded matcher defaults, and one-time legacy-state migration |
| `internal/catalogue` | Embedded versioned classical-catalogue symbols, strict registry validation, and normalized reference parsing |
| `internal/netx` | Shared HTTP retry, concurrency, and rate-limit behavior |

Bilibili video search uses the typed WBI endpoint with Unicode-safe signing and
two isolated identities. Anonymous search starts from its own persistent device
jar and can accept first-party device cookies, but it never imports account
cookies. Session search uses the authenticated jar and is partitioned by MID.
Each identity has separate WBI and fingerprint state. HTTP/API rejection details
remain typed errors, and a Gaia risk-control voucher is reported as a challenge
rather than misrepresented as an empty search result.

## Public and internal data

The root package returns public snapshots rather than exposing internal models
or site-client response types. Conversion at the public boundary is deliberate:
it lets internal representations evolve without silently changing the reusable
API. Slices and nested values returned by the engine are caller-owned.

Matching depends on a strategy seam rather than a ranking-only interface. The
configured matcher resolves one immutable scorer per match or candidate-search
call, so concurrent calls can safely use standard, classical, or custom
relative weights. A scorer supplies ordered query phases, ranks the deduplicated
aggregate on six normalized components, and decides whether the service should
stop or continue. Standard mode may stop after exact artist evidence; classical
mode always aggregates the title-only fallback. Both apply profile-specific
title, total-score, and runner-up thresholds, and every unresolved outcome
carries a public review reason.

The classical scorer also consults the dependency-free `internal/catalogue`
parser. When the source song name and candidate title contain the same complete
catalogue reference, the title component becomes 100 before the configured six
weights are applied. Standard scoring never invokes this boost, and a catalogue
mismatch leaves the existing similarity score unchanged. Registry provenance,
versioning, and the strict identifier grammar are documented in
[`classical-catalogues.md`](classical-catalogues.md).

The CLI's full-screen and plain frontends share one conversion session for
login, Chromium installation/retry, parsing, matching, manual search, favorite
operations, and writes. Bubble Tea consumes serialized observer and result
messages through a channel. Its operation context is cancelled when the UI
closes, and the controller waits for active backend work before returning.

## Search and recovery state

Adaptive matching is page-width-first and profile-aware. The service rescores
the aggregate after every page and stops at the profile decision threshold;
retained candidate count does not control request count. Defaults are five
candidates, two workers, two search requests per second with burst one, and a
four-remote-request budget per song. Cache hits do not consume that budget.

The Bilibili boundary caches unscored page snapshots under
`CacheDir/search/v1/`, partitioned by an opaque anonymous fingerprint hash or
session MID. This allows matcher and weight changes to rescore cached videos.
Positive pages expire after seven days, empty pages after one hour, and errors
are not cached. Corrupt search entries are quarantined because they are
rebuildable.

The CLI boundary owns `ConfigDir/conversions/v1/` checkpoints and
`ConfigDir/decisions/v1/` cross-playlist decisions. Songs align by stable source
ID rather than position. Checkpoint and decision corruption is fatal and the
original file is preserved. Version 1 is additive: write-receipt fields are
optional, and no Phase 1-3 state operation overwrites or migrates the existing
account-cookie file.

Favorite writes emit a receipt for every completed remote item. The CLI saves
each receipt atomically inside the playlist checkpoint, keyed by target favorite
ID, and filters already-successful BVIDs on retry. Failed receipts remain
observable but are eligible for retry. The write gate requires every song to be
selected or explicitly skipped and rejects all writes after a session
risk-control halt; cached candidates remain available for offline review.

`internal/service` defines interfaces at the point where they are consumed and
continues to receive decoded `model.Song` values. `internal/playlist` sits behind
that boundary; provider IDs, raw candidates, registries, and optimization
interfaces do not enter the public package or service API. Concrete Kugou,
Apple Music, Bilibili, browser, matcher, and storage implementations are
assembled only in `internal/wiring`. Tests can therefore replace external I/O
without routing through terminal code.

The public `ParsePlaylist` and `ParsePlaylistWithOptions` methods, browser-policy
types, `HTTPClients.Kugou`, additive `HTTPClients.AppleMusic`, and
`WithBrowserExtractor` remain compatibility boundaries. The injected public
browser extractor still returns public `Song` values; the root adapter converts
them into canonical internal candidates.

## Playlist providers and registries

Provider identification and provider optimizations are deliberately separate.
Each engine receives two immutable registries assembled explicitly by
`internal/wiring`:

- The identification registry contains a `ProviderID` and a pure URL identifier.
- The optimization registry is keyed by `ProviderID` and contains optional,
  category-specific capability slices.

URL validation happens centrally before identification and accepts only HTTP(S)
URLs with a host. Exactly one matching identifier selects that provider, no
matches select the generic provider, and multiple matches are treated as an
internal registration error. Identifiers use parsed hostnames and boundary-safe
suffix matching; registration order never decides identity. A known provider may
intentionally have no optimizations, demonstrating that identity and capability
availability are independent. There is no global `init` registration.

## Capability composition

Optimizations use small typed interfaces with only a diagnostic `Name` in
common. Playlist extractors produce ordered raw track candidates and an optional
expected total. Title extractors interpret candidates, and song normalizers
transform decoded songs. This avoids a string-keyed capability map and avoids a
monolithic provider interface.

Playlist extractors run in registration order until a non-empty complete result
is found. A result is incomplete only when its declared total is greater than the
number of decoded songs; a non-empty result without a declared total is complete.
Provider title extractors run before the common field-and-visible-text extractor,
and the first valid title wins. All registered normalizers compose in order after
decoding, whether candidates came from a provider extractor or Chromium. Omitting
a capability category selects its common fallback.

When a provider result is empty or incomplete, the coordinator may merge it with
the browser result. Provider data takes precedence, and deduplication retains the
existing hash and trimmed title/artist semantics. Failed capability attempts
carry provider ID, capability category, optimization name, and their underlying
error for internal diagnostics; they do not create a new public error category.

Kugou and Apple Music are currently optimized sources. The Apple Music
extractor fetches the unauthenticated public share page through the shared
rate-limited HTTP stack, selects the `trackLockup` section matching the URL's
playlist ID, and reads its declared `trackCount`. A short server-rendered result
therefore remains useful partial data while still triggering the common
Chromium fallback. Apple-specific page structure stays in `internal/applemusic`;
the shared browser extractor contains only provider-neutral candidate rules.

## Browser fallback policy

Chromium is a coordinator-owned common fallback rather than a capability
implicitly attached to every provider.

| Policy | Processing |
|---|---|
| `never` | Run registered provider playlist optimizations only. An unoptimized provider returns an extraction error without launching or installing Chromium. |
| `auto` | Run provider optimizations, then lazily provision the bundled browser and notify before Chromium fallback for an empty or incomplete result. Preserve useful partial songs if the browser is unavailable or fallback fails. |
| `always` | Require an injected, verified installed, or bundled browser before processing. Still run provider optimizations first and launch Chromium only for an empty or incomplete result. |

Release builds compile the pinned target-platform Chromium archive into the Go
binary behind the `bundled_chromium` build tag. Each platform has independent
version, source commit, snapshot revision, object generation, publication time,
archive size, and SHA-256 provenance in the embedded schema-2 manifest. The
archive is verified against that manifest and lazily extracted into the managed
cache only when it is required. The install record binds the verified executable
to the same Chromium version and commit, so a stale cache cannot satisfy a new
manifest. This provisioning path performs no network access and prompts for no
approval. If an ordinary source build has no bundled archive, the CLI owns a
final automatic download, install, and retry path and notifies instead of
prompting. `never` disables both paths.

The release pipeline runs each target archive on its native architecture.
Chromium snapshots intentionally build a sample-only `chrome://credits` page,
so release packages instead use the checked-in complete credits artifact. Its
official generated base, source-delta audit, supplemental entries, and SHA-256
are recorded in the manifest and `CHROMIUM_PROVENANCE.md`; tests reject
truncation, missing required notices, and the upstream sample page. Packages
also include the Chromium BSD notice and both human- and machine-readable
provenance records.
Cancellation or deadline expiry always wins over partial success; other
fallback errors are ignored when usable songs exist and are aggregated only
when no songs can be returned. Malformed URLs, cancellation, extraction
failures, and missing required Chromium continue to map to the existing public
error categories and CLI exit codes.

## Configuration ownership

Matcher defaults are source-controlled in `internal/config/defaults` and
embedded into the executable. Files named `b.txt`, `w.txt`, and `w-up.txt` in
the user configuration directory are optional complete overrides.

Root files with those names are treated only as legacy user state during the
one-time migration. They are intentionally ignored by Git and are not project
defaults.

## Test tiers

- `go test ./...` runs unit, fixture, and boundary tests without
  requiring authenticated remote writes.
- `go test -race ./...` validates concurrent matching, observers, clients, and
  injected dependencies.
- The `live` tag enables read-only network canaries.
- The anonymous live-search canary additionally requires
  `MUSIC2BB_RUN_ANON_SEARCH_CANARY=1` and verifies that sentinel account cookies
  are absent from real anonymous requests.
- The `browser_install` tag validates a pinned Chromium archive, launch, and
  controlled extraction.
- The `authenticated` tag can create and remove temporary Bilibili resources;
  it additionally requires `MUSIC2BB_RUN_AUTH_CANARY=1`.

## Extending the system

- Add terminal-only behavior to `internal/cli`.
- Add orchestration rules and dependency interfaces to `internal/service`.
- Give a playlist source a stable internal `ProviderID` and a pure identifier.
- Keep site protocol details in the corresponding integration package and
  implement only the typed optimization categories it supports.
- Register the identifier and optimization set independently and explicitly in
  `internal/wiring`. A capability implementation may be reused under another
  provider ID.
- Add a future capability category by defining its typed input/output interface,
  adding its optional slice to the optimization set, and integrating it at the
  relevant ingestion stage; existing providers need no implementation changes.
- Change public types or methods only when the reusable API itself must change.

Provider detection is automatic and providers are compiled into the application.
Do not add a CLI provider switch, public registration API, runtime plugin ABI, or
global registration side effect.
